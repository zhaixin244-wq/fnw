# Stage 5: skill_d (inline)

**Goal**: Read RTL files, perform quality checks, write static_report.json.

Mark Stage 5 task as **in_progress** using TaskUpdate.

## 5a. Read inputs

Use **Read** tool to read every file in `$PROJECT_DIR/workspace/rtl/*.v` and `$PROJECT_DIR/workspace/docs/spec.json`.

## 5b. Perform checks

Check for (do NOT run EDA tools):

**A. Static Checks**:
1. `initial` blocks in RTL files
2. Empty or near-empty files
3. Missing `endmodule`
4. Obvious syntax issues

**B. Deep Code Review**:
1. Latch inference: missing `case`/`if` branches in combinational logic
2. Combinational loops: feedback paths in combinational logic
3. Uninitialized registers: registers used before assignment in reset path
4. Non-synthesizable constructs: `$display`, `#delay` (non-TB), `initial` (non-TB)
5. Clock domain crossing: multi-clock-domain signals without synchronizers

**C. Logic Depth Estimate**:
- Each gate/operator = 1 level
- Multiplier trees = ~log2(width) levels
- Adder carries = ~log2(width)/2 levels
- Compare against `critical_path_budget` from spec.json

**D. Resource Estimate**:
- Each flip-flop = 1 cell
- Each 2-input logic gate = 0.5 cells
- Each mux = 1 cell per bit
- Each adder = 1 cell per bit
- Compare against `constraints.area.max_cells` (or `max_luts`/`max_ffs` if specified) from spec.json

**E. Constraint Compliance**:
- Verify logic depth fits within `constraints.timing.critical_path_ns`
- Verify estimated resources fit within `constraints.area` limits
- Verify clock gating is present if `constraints.power.clock_gating` is true
- Flag any violations as error-level issues

**F. Functional Completeness**:
1. Read spec.json ¡ª extract each module's `description` and `ports`
2. For each RTL file in `workspace/rtl/`:
   - Verify all ports declared in spec.json are present in the Verilog module
   - Scan for comments or patterns indicating incomplete implementation:
     - `"simplified"`, `"placeholder"`, `"TODO"`, `"FIXME"`, `"for now"`
     - `assign` statements that directly connect input to output without processing
     - Modules shorter than 20 lines (likely stubs)
   - For algorithm-heavy modules: verify the module contains FSM or sequential logic proportional to the algorithm complexity described in micro_arch.md
3. Flag any module where the implementation obviously doesn't match the spec description as **error-level**

## 5c. Write static_report.json

Use **Write** tool to write `$PROJECT_DIR/workspace/docs/static_report.json`.

Format:
```json
{
  "design": "<design_name>",
  "analyzed_files": ["<file1.v>", "<file2.v>"],
  "logic_depth_estimate": {
    "max_levels": 0,
    "budget": 0,
    "status": "OK|OVER_BUDGET|UNKNOWN",
    "worst_path": "<description>"
  },
  "resource_estimate": {
    "cells": 0,
    "luts": 0,
    "ffs": 0,
    "brams": 0,
    "status": "OK|OVER_BUDGET|UNKNOWN",
    "budget": {}
  },
  "cdc_risks": [],
  "latch_risks": [],
  "constraint_violations": [],
  "functional_gaps": [],
  "recommendation": "<single most important suggestion>"
}
```

Quality score (0-1). Pass threshold: 0.5. Auto-fail if any error-level issues exist. Severity per issue: error / warning / info.

## 5d. Hook

```bash
test -f "$PROJECT_DIR/workspace/docs/static_report.json" && echo "[HOOK] PASS" || echo "[HOOK] FAIL"
```

If FAIL ¡ú rewrite immediately.

## 5e. Save state

```bash
$PYTHON_EXE "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/state.py" "$PROJECT_DIR" "skill_d"
```

Mark Stage 5 task as **completed** using TaskUpdate.

## 5f. Journal

```bash
printf "\n## Stage: skill_d\n**Status**: completed\n**Timestamp**: $(date -Iseconds)\n**Outputs**: workspace/docs/static_report.json\n**Notes**: Static analysis complete.\n" >> "$PROJECT_DIR/workspace/docs/stage_journal.md"
```
